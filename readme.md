This is a program meant for practicing spanish through flashcards. It requires the tkinter module (pip intsall tk). Documentation is as follows:

## How to Format The CSV:
If you want to add any words, you need to separate the words with a comma (no space). Each pair is separated by a new line, that is how to add a new word. 

## How The Program Reads The CSV:
The program reads the csv by rows, each new row is a new word. These words are saved in a list, so if you format them wrong, they will not display properly. 
Also, the program uses relative dependencies, which means that the CSV needs to be in the same folder as the executable/python file.

## How to use the program:
The flip button flips the flashcard over. The next button goes to the next randomized card.
